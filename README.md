# International-Baccalaureate-Physics-Extended-Essay
Part of my Physics Extended Essay made during the last 2 years in high school. Uses EyesWeb and OpenCV to compute position of centroid in a thrown tennis racket and extracts results to a file.

EyesWeb is a visual programming "platform to support the design and development of real time multimodal systems and interfaces." More details and the downloadable software to run the application (or patch) can be found at http://www.infomus.org/eyesweb_ita.php.

The image in the Github repository is a screenshot of the image processing section in the EyesWeb Patch which was used to extract and display the data from the video recordings.

The "video_files" folder in the Github repository includes a sample of files which can be loaded in the EyesWeb patch, on the very right 2 video file readers. The background.avi file must always be loaded in the bottom reader, whilst the actual file in the top one. To run the patch, press F5.
